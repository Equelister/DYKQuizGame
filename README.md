DYKQuizGame is a multiplayer quiz game created using C# programming language, WPF graphics engine and MS SQL database.
The architecture of the application is client-server. The client application connects to the erected server via TCP/IP protocol, which processes each of its requests.

The application was created as part of an engineering thesis.

The user can:
- Create/log into an account
- View created lobbies,
- Create their own lobbies,
- Participate in regular or varied gameplay
- View their gameplay history

The user interface is entirely in Polish.

Below are some sample screenshots of how the application works.
